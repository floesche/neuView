## Key Improvements

### 1. Bounded Contexts Implementation

**Previous State**: Single monolithic domain without clear boundaries.

**Improvement**: Defined three distinct bounded contexts:

#### Neuron Discovery Context
- **Responsibility**: Discovering, cataloging, and managing neuron types
- **Entities**: `NeuronTypeRegistry`, `NeuronTypeEntry`, `NeuronTypeMetadata`
- **Value Objects**: `NeuronTypeId`, `NeuronTypeClassification`, `TypeAvailability`
- **Domain Services**: `NeuronTypeDiscoveryService`, `NeuronTypeValidationService`

#### Connectivity Analysis Context  
- **Responsibility**: Analyzing synaptic connections and patterns
- **Entities**: `ConnectivityNetwork`, `SynapticConnection`
- **Domain Services**: `ConnectivityCalculationService`, `PatternAnalysisService`

#### Report Generation Context
- **Responsibility**: Creating formatted reports and visualizations
- **Entities**: `ReportTemplate`, `GeneratedReport`
- **Domain Services**: `ReportCompilationService`, `VisualizationService`

### 2. Domain Services Layer

**Previous State**: Complex business logic scattered across application services and entities.

**Improvement**: Created dedicated domain services for sophisticated operations:

```python
# Example: NeuronAnalysisService
class NeuronAnalysisService:
    def analyze_neuron_collection_quality(self, collection: NeuronCollection) -> NeuronAnalysisResult:
        """Comprehensive quality analysis with outlier detection, statistics, and recommendations"""
        
    def compare_neuron_collections(self, collection1, collection2) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Compare collections for similarities and differences"""
        
    def identify_connectivity_patterns(self, collection) -> List[ConnectivityPattern]:
        """Identify significant connectivity motifs"""
        
    def assess_bilateral_symmetry(self, collection) -> Dict[str, Any]:
        """Evaluate left-right hemisphere symmetry"""
```

**Benefits**:
- Complex business logic properly encapsulated
- Stateless operations that can coordinate multiple entities
- Clear domain concepts expressed in code
- Improved testability and maintainability

### 3. Specification Pattern

**Previous State**: Business rules hard-coded throughout the application.

**Improvement**: Implemented composable specifications for business rules:

```python
# Business rules as composable specifications
high_quality = HighQualityNeuronSpecification(min_synapses=100, min_rois=3)
bilateral = BilateralNeuronSpecification()
left_side = SomaSideSpecification(SomaSide('left'))

# Compose complex rules
high_quality_bilateral_left = high_quality & bilateral & left_side

# Apply to collections
filtered_neurons = [n for n in neurons if high_quality_bilateral_left.is_satisfied_by(n)]
```

**Available Specifications**:
- `HighQualityNeuronSpecification`: Quality criteria validation
- `SomaSideSpecification`: Soma side filtering  
- `HasRoiSpecification`: ROI presence validation
- `SynapseCountRangeSpecification`: Synapse count ranges
- `PrePostRatioSpecification`: Pre/post synapse ratios
- `BilateralCollectionSpecification`: Collection bilateral validation

**Benefits**:
- Business rules are explicit and testable
- Rules can be composed using logical operators
- Dynamic query building capabilities
- Consistent rule application across the domain

### 4. Domain Events System

**Previous State**: No mechanism for decoupled communication between components.

**Improvement**: Comprehensive domain events system:

```python
# Domain events for important occurrences
@dataclass(frozen=True) 
class NeuronTypeDiscovered(DomainEvent):
    registry_id: UUID
    type_id: NeuronTypeId
    classification: NeuronTypeClassification
    discovered_at: datetime
    
    @property
    def event_type(self) -> str:
        return "neuron_type_discovered"

# Event handling
async def handle_neuron_type_discovered(event: NeuronTypeDiscovered):
    """Update statistics and notify interested parties"""
    logger.info(f"New neuron type discovered: {event.type_id}")
    # Additional processing...

# Subscribe to events
event_publisher.subscribe(
    handler=handle_neuron_type_discovered,
    event_types=[NeuronTypeDiscovered],
    priority=EventPriority.HIGH
)
```

**Features**:
- Immutable event objects with metadata
- Async event processing with retry logic
- Priority-based event handling
- Event store support for audit trails
- Global event publisher for system-wide events

**Benefits**:
- Loose coupling between domain components
- Side effects handled separately from core logic
- Audit trail and event sourcing capabilities
- Integration between bounded contexts

### 5. CQRS Implementation

**Previous State**: Mixed read/write operations in single services.

**Improvement**: Complete Command Query Responsibility Segregation:

#### Query Side (Reads)
```python
# Specialized DTOs for different views
@dataclass
class NeuronSummaryDTO:
    body_id: int
    neuron_type: str
    total_synapses: int
    primary_rois: List[str]
    # Optimized for list views

@dataclass  
class NeuronTypeStatisticsDTO:
    type_name: str
    total_count: int
    quality_score: float
    top_rois: List[Dict[str, Any]]
    # Optimized for analysis views

# Query handlers for specific read scenarios
class GetNeuronTypeDetailQueryHandler:
    async def handle(self, query: GetNeuronTypeDetailQuery) -> Result[NeuronTypeDetailResult, str]:
        # Optimized for detailed neuron type analysis
        
class SearchNeuronsQueryHandler:
    async def handle(self, query: SearchNeuronsQuery) -> Result[NeuronSearchResult, str]:
        # Optimized for faceted search with pagination
```

#### Command Side (Writes)
```python
# Commands represent write intentions
@dataclass
class GeneratePageCommand:
    neuron_type: NeuronTypeName
    soma_side: SomaSide
    include_connectivity: bool
    # Business validation built-in
    
    def validate(self) -> List[str]:
        """Validate command parameters"""
        
# Command handlers modify state
class PageGenerationService:
    async def generate_page(self, command: GeneratePageCommand) -> Result[str, str]:
        # State modification with domain events
```

**Benefits**:
- Optimized read models for different use cases
- Scalable query performance
- Clear separation of concerns
- Different consistency models for reads vs writes

### 6. Domain Factories

**Previous State**: Direct entity instantiation scattered throughout code.

**Improvement**: Specialized factories for complex entity creation:

```python
class NeuronFactory:
    def create_from_neuprint_data(self, neuprint_data: Dict) -> Result[Neuron, str]:
        """Create neuron from NeuPrint with full validation"""
        
    def create_from_user_input(self, body_id: int, neuron_type: str, ...) -> Result[Neuron, str]:
        """Create neuron from user input with business rules"""
        
    def create_test_neuron(self, **kwargs) -> Neuron:
        """Create test neuron with sensible defaults"""

class NeuronCollectionFactory:
    def create_from_neuprint_results(self, results: List[Dict]) -> Result[NeuronCollection, str]:
        """Create collection with aggregate validation"""
        
    def merge_collections(self, collections: List[NeuronCollection]) -> Result[NeuronCollection, str]:
        """Merge collections with duplicate handling"""
```

**Benefits**:
- Complex creation logic encapsulated
- Business invariants maintained during creation
- Consistent entity creation across the application
- Support for different data sources

### 7. Clean CLI Architecture

**Previous State**: Legacy `ApplicationBootstrap` with wrapper classes mixing old and new patterns.

**Improvement**: Complete DDD-based CLI application:

```python
class CLIApplication:
    """Composition root for dependency injection"""
    
    async def initialize(self):
        """Wire up all dependencies using DDD principles"""
        # Domain services
        # Infrastructure adapters  
        # Application services
        # Event system
        # Query handlers
        
    async def generate_page(self, neuron_type: str, ...) -> Result[str, str]:
        """Clean interface using domain objects"""
        
    async def search_neurons(self, criteria: ...) -> Result[Dict, str]:
        """CQRS-based search with DTOs"""
```

## Implementation Guide

### 1. Getting Started
```bash
# The new DDD structure is ready to use
cd quickpage/src/quickpage

# Key entry points:
# - presentation/cli_application.py: Main application
# - core/domains/: Bounded contexts  
# - core/services/: Domain services
# - core/specifications/: Business rules
# - application/queries/handlers.py: CQRS queries
```

### 2. Using Specifications
```python
from quickpage.core.specifications import (
    HighQualityNeuronSpecification, 
    SomaSideSpecification,
    filter_neurons
)

# Create business rule
high_quality_left = (
    HighQualityNeuronSpecification(min_synapses=200) & 
    SomaSideSpecification(SomaSide('left'))
)

# Apply to neurons
qualified_neurons = filter_neurons(all_neurons, high_quality_left)
```

### 3. Using Domain Services
```python
from quickpage.core.services import NeuronAnalysisService

analysis_service = NeuronAnalysisService()
quality_result = analysis_service.analyze_neuron_collection_quality(collection)

print(f"Quality Score: {quality_result.quality_score}")
print(f"Outliers: {len(quality_result.outliers)}")
print(f"Recommendations: {quality_result.recommendations}")
```

### 4. Using CQRS Queries
```python
from quickpage.application.queries.handlers import (
    GetNeuronTypeDetailQuery, execute_query
)

query = GetNeuronTypeDetailQuery(
    neuron_type="DA1", 
    include_connectivity=True,
    include_individual_neurons=False
)

result = await execute_query(query)
if result.is_ok():
    details = result.value
    print(f"Statistics: {details.statistics}")
```

### 5. Working with Domain Events
```python
from quickpage.shared.domain_events import subscribe_to_events

async def handle_analysis_complete(event):
    print(f"Analysis completed for: {event.collection_id}")
    
# Subscribe to events
subscribe_to_events(
    handler=handle_analysis_complete,
    event_types=[AnalysisCompleted]
)
```
