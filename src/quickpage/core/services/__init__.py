"""
Domain Services for QuickPage Core Domain

Domain services contain business logic that doesn't naturally fit within
a single entity or value object. They coordinate between multiple entities
and handle complex domain operations that span across aggregate boundaries.

Key Characteristics of Domain Services:
- Stateless operations
- Express important business concepts
- Coordinate multiple entities/aggregates
- Contain logic that doesn't belong to any single entity
- Are part of the domain layer (not application services)
