# View Indicator Highlighting Fix Summary

## Problem Identified

When filtering neuron types by soma side (e.g., "only Left" or "Undefined"), the view indicator tags were not being highlighted correctly for neuron types that contained multiple tags. Specifically:

- **R8d** has both "Undefined" and "only L" tags
- When filtering by "only Left", the "only L" tag was not being highlighted
- When filtering by "Undefined", the "Undefined" tag was not being highlighted

This made it unclear which filter was active and which neuron types matched the current filter.

## Root Cause

The highlighting logic in the JavaScript `updateHighlighting()` function was using overly restrictive conditions that prevented highlighting when multiple view indicator tags were present on the same card:

```javascript
// PROBLEMATIC CODE (before fix)
const shouldHighlight =
    (currentSomaFilter === "left" &&
        indicator.hasClass("left") &&
        hasLeft &&
        !hasRight &&
        !hasMiddle &&
        !hasUndefined) ||  // ← This prevented highlighting when undefined was present
    (currentSomaFilter === "undefined" &&
        indicator.hasClass("undefined") &&
        hasUndefined &&
        !hasLeft &&        // ← This prevented highlighting when left was present
        !hasRight &&
        !hasMiddle);
```

The logic required that ONLY the target side type be present, which meant:
- For "left" filter: no highlighting if undefined, right, or middle tags were also present
- For "undefined" filter: no highlighting if left, right, or middle tags were also present

## Solution Implemented

Simplified the highlighting logic to work independently for each tag type, similar to the click handler fix:

```javascript
// FIXED CODE (after fix)
const shouldHighlight =
    (currentSomaFilter === "left" && indicator.hasClass("left")) ||
    (currentSomaFilter === "right" && indicator.hasClass("right")) ||
    (currentSomaFilter === "middle" && indicator.hasClass("middle")) ||
    (currentSomaFilter === "undefined" && indicator.hasClass("undefined"));
```

This change means:
- When filtering by "left", ALL "only L" tags get highlighted (regardless of other tags present)
- When filtering by "undefined", ALL "Undefined" tags get highlighted (regardless of other tags present)
- Each tag type is evaluated independently

## Expected Behavior After Fix

### For Mixed Tag Neuron Types (e.g., R8d)

| Filter Selected | Expected Highlighting |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "only Left" | Only the "only L" tag should be highlighted |
| "Undefined" | Only the "Undefined" tag should be highlighted |
| "Any" | No tags should be highlighted |

### For Single Tag Neuron Types

| Neuron Type | Filter Selected | Expected Highlighting |
|-------------|----------------|----------------------|
| PhG11 (undefined only) | "Undefined" | "Undefined" tag highlighted |
| Traditional type (left only) | "only Left" | "only L" tag highlighted |

## Visual Impact

- ✅ **Clear Visual Feedback**: Users can now see which tags match their selected filter
- ✅ **Independent Operation**: Multiple tags on the same card highlight independently
- ✅ **Consistent Behavior**: Highlighting works the same way for all tag combinations
- ✅ **Better UX**: Users can easily understand which neuron types match their current filter

## Files Modified

- `quickpage/templates/types.html`: Updated `updateHighlighting()` function to use independent tag evaluation

## Verification

### Test Cases Verified

1. **R8d (both "Undefined" and "only L")**:
   - Filter by "only Left" → only "only L" tag highlighted ✅
   - Filter by "Undefined" → only "Undefined" tag highlighted ✅

2. **PhG11/SNta35 ("Undefined" only)**:
   - Filter by "Undefined" → "Undefined" tag highlighted ✅

3. **Traditional neuron types**:
   - Single tags highlight correctly when matching filter ✅

### Testing Tools Created

- `quickpage/test_highlighting.html`: Interactive test page with multiple test cases
- Automated verification scripts to test all filter combinations

## User Instructions

1. **Open the generated types.html page**
2. **Use the "Soma Side" dropdown** to select different filters
3. **Observe the tag highlighting** - tags should show a thick border when they match the current filter
4. **Test mixed tag cases** like R8d to verify independent highlighting
5. **Switch between filters** to see highlighting update correctly

The visual feedback should now be clear and consistent across all neuron type cards, making it easy to understand which types match the current soma side filter.

## Related Fixes

This highlighting fix complements the earlier click handler fix:

- **Click Handler Fix**: Ensured tags work independently when clicked
- **Highlighting Fix**: Ensures tags highlight independently when filters are applied
- **Combined Result**: Complete independent operation of multiple tags on the same card

Both fixes together provide a seamless user experience for neuron types with mixed soma side assignments.
