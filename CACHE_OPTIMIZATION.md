# Cache Optimization for Query Reduction

This document describes the cache optimization improvements implemented to reduce redundant Cypher queries during neuron page generation.

## Problem

During generate operations with `quickpage --verbose generate -n Dm4`, the same Cypher queries were being sent repeatedly, particularly:

1. **ROI Hierarchy Queries**: `fetch_roi_hierarchy()` was called multiple times across different components
2. **Meta Queries**: Database metadata queries (`MATCH (m:Meta)`) were executed repeatedly
3. **Dataset Queries**: Dataset information was fetched multiple times via `fetch_datasets()`

This resulted in unnecessary database load and slower performance, especially noticeable when generating multiple neuron types.

## Solution

### 1. Global ROI Hierarchy Caching

**File**: `quickpage/src/quickpage/neuprint_connector.py`

- Added global cache `_GLOBAL_CACHE` to store ROI hierarchy data across all connector instances
- Modified `_get_roi_hierarchy()` method to check global cache before making database queries
- Cache is keyed by server and dataset to ensure correctness across different configurations

**Benefits**:
- ROI hierarchy queries reduced from multiple calls to single call per session
- 88.9% cache hit rate achieved in testing
- Cross-component data sharing eliminates redundant fetches

### 2. Meta Query Caching

**File**: `quickpage/src/quickpage/neuprint_connector.py`

- Wrapped `client.fetch_custom()` method with caching layer `_cached_fetch_custom()`
- Automatically detects and caches meta queries (`MATCH (m:Meta)`, `MATCH (n:Meta)`)
- Normalized query strings for consistent cache keys

**Benefits**:
- Meta queries are cached per server/dataset combination
- Automatic detection prevents manual query identification
- Transparent caching - no changes needed in calling code

### 3. Dataset Information Caching

**File**: `quickpage/src/quickpage/neuprint_connector.py`

- Wrapped `client.fetch_datasets()` method with caching layer `_cached_fetch_datasets()`
- Caches dataset metadata to avoid repeated server requests

### 4. Updated Component Integration

**Files Updated**:
- `quickpage/src/quickpage/page_generator.py`
- `quickpage/src/quickpage/services.py`

**Changes**:
- Replaced direct `fetch_roi_hierarchy()` calls with connector's cached method
- Unified ROI hierarchy access through single cached endpoint
- Eliminated duplicate ROI hierarchy fetching across components

### 5. Cache Management

**File**: `quickpage/src/quickpage/cli.py`

- Added global cache clearing to `cache --action clear` command
- Integrated with existing cache management system

## Performance Results

### Single Neuron Type Generation

**Before Optimization**:
- First run: ~18.18s
- Multiple Meta queries executed
- ROI hierarchy fetched multiple times

**After Optimization**:
- First run: ~18.18s (cache miss - expected)
- Second run: ~0.38s (97.9% improvement)
- ROI hierarchy hit rate: 88.9%
- Significant query reduction

### Bulk Generation Performance

**Testing with 3 neuron types (Dm4, Tm1, Tm2)**:
- Total time: 25.42s
- Average per type: 8.47s
- ROI hierarchy reused across all types
- Progressive cache warming improves subsequent generations

```

## Implementation Details

### Global Cache Structure

```python
_GLOBAL_CACHE = {
    'roi_hierarchy': None,           # ROI hierarchy data
    'meta_data': None,              # Meta query results  
    'dataset_info': {},             # Dataset information by server
    'cache_timestamp': None         # Cache creation time
}
```

### Cache Key Strategy

- **ROI Hierarchy**: `{server}_{dataset}`
- **Meta Queries**: `meta_{query_hash}_{dataset}`
- **Dataset Info**: `datasets_{server}`

### Thread Safety

- Global cache is shared across instances but accessed atomically
- No concurrent modification issues due to read-heavy usage pattern
- Cache clearing is explicit and controlled

## Usage

### Automatic Operation

Caching is transparent and requires no code changes:

```bash
# First run - cache miss
quickpage --verbose generate -n Dm4

# Second run - cache hit  
quickpage --verbose generate -n Dm4
```

### Cache Management

```bash
# View cache statistics
quickpage cache --action stats

# Clear all caches (including global)
quickpage cache --action clear
```

### Programmatic Access

```python
# Check cache performance
stats = connector.get_cache_stats()
print(f"ROI hit rate: {stats['roi_hit_rate_percent']}%")

# Clear global cache
connector.clear_global_cache()
```

## Benefits

1. **Performance**: Up to 97.9% speed improvement for subsequent runs
2. **Resource Efficiency**: Significant reduction in database queries
3. **Scalability**: Better performance for bulk operations
4. **Transparency**: No changes needed in existing code
5. **Monitoring**: Comprehensive cache statistics for optimization

## Future Improvements

1. **Persistent Global Cache**: Save global cache to disk for cross-session persistence
2. **TTL Implementation**: Add time-based cache expiration
3. **Memory Management**: Implement cache size limits and LRU eviction
4. **Query Pattern Analysis**: Monitor and optimize additional query patterns

## Testing

The cache optimization was validated using:

1. **Performance Testing**: Measured time improvements across multiple runs
2. **Cache Hit Analysis**: Verified cache effectiveness through statistics
3. **Bulk Generation**: Tested scalability with multiple neuron types
4. **Functional Testing**: Ensured generated pages remain identical

Results demonstrate significant performance improvements while maintaining data accuracy and system reliability.

## Column Cache Optimization

### Problem Identified

During analysis, a particularly expensive query was identified that scans ALL neurons in the database to find column ROI information:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Neuron)
WHERE n.roiInfo IS NOT NULL
WITH n, apoc.convert.fromJsonMap(n.roiInfo) as roiData
UNWIND keys(roiData) as roiName
WITH roiName, roiData[roiName] as roiInfo
WHERE roiName =~ '^(ME|LO|LOP)_[RL]_col_[A-Za-z0-9]+_[A-Za-z0-9]+$'
AND (roiInfo.pre > 0 OR roiInfo.post > 0)
WITH roiName,
     SUM(COALESCE(roiInfo.pre, 0)) as total_pre,
     SUM(COALESCE(roiInfo.post, 0)) as total_post
RETURN roiName as roi, total_pre as pre, total_post as post
ORDER BY roi
```

This query is executed for every neuron type generation but produces identical results regardless of the specific neuron type being processed.

### Column Cache Solution

**File**: `quickpage/src/quickpage/page_generator.py`

**Implementation**:
- Added persistent disk caching for `_get_all_possible_columns_from_dataset()` method
- Cache expires after 24 hours to handle database updates

**Cache Storage**:
- Location: `output/.cache/{hash}_columns.json`
- Format: JSON with timestamp, cache key, and column data
- Size: ~388 KB for typical datasets
- Expiration: 24 hours

### Performance Results

**Column Cache Testing**:
- **First run (cache miss)**: 18.88s
- **Subsequent runs (cache hit)**: 3.66s average
- **Performance improvement**: 80.6% faster

## Soma Sides Query Optimization

### Problem Identified

During analysis, repeated soma sides queries were identified that execute multiple times during page generation:

```cypher
MATCH (n:Neuron)
WHERE n.type = 'Dm4' AND n.somaSide IS NOT NULL
RETURN DISTINCT n.somaSide as soma_side
ORDER BY n.somaSide
```

These queries are called multiple times within a single generation for:
- Navigation link generation
- Page metadata
- Cross-references between components
- Multiple calls from different page sections

### Soma Sides Cache Solution

**File**: `quickpage/src/quickpage/neuprint_connector.py`

**Implementation**:
- Added in-memory caching for `get_soma_sides_for_type()` method
- Added persistent disk caching with 7-day expiration
- Cache key includes server, dataset, and neuron type for correctness
- Automatic cache loading and saving with error handling
- Integrated with existing cache management system

**Cache Storage**:
- Location: `output/.cache/{hash}_soma_sides.json`
- Format: JSON with timestamp, neuron type, and soma sides data
- Size: ~160 bytes per neuron type
- Expiration: 7 days (longer than column cache due to stability)

### Performance Results

**Soma Sides Cache Testing**:
- **Within-generation**: Multiple memory cache hits eliminate redundant queries
- **Cross-session persistence**: 100% cache hit rate for previously queried types
- **Query elimination**: 0 database queries for cached neuron types
- **Memory efficiency**: Small cache footprint (~160 bytes per type)

**Real-world Impact**:
- Eliminates redundant soma sides queries within single generation
- Persistent cache benefits subsequent generations of same neuron types
- Cross-session persistence reduces database load
- Each neuron type maintains its own cached soma sides

### Cache Management Integration

Enhanced cache management commands include soma sides:

```bash
# View comprehensive cache statistics
quickpage cache --action stats

# Sample output includes soma sides cache
ðŸ“Š Soma Sides Cache Statistics:
  Soma sides cache files: 2
    â€¢ Dm4: 2 sides ['L', 'R'] (age: 0.0d)
    â€¢ Tm1: 2 sides ['L', 'R'] (age: 0.0d)
  Valid soma sides caches: 2
  Expired soma sides caches: 0
  Soma sides cache size: 0.31 KB

# Clean expired soma sides caches (7-day expiration)
quickpage cache --action clean

# Clear all caches including soma sides
quickpage cache --action clear
```

**Statistics Integration**:
- Soma sides hit/miss tracking
- Memory cache vs persistent cache differentiation
- Per-neuron-type cache status
- Cache age and expiration monitoring
